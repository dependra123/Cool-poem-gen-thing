386,1,"sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad"
387,1,"made to his mistress' eyebrow, then a soldier,"
388,1,"full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,"

795,19,"mark how one string, sweet husband to another,"
796,19,"strikes each in each by mutual ordering,"
797,19,"resembling sire and child and happy mother"
798,19,"who all in one, one pleasing note do sing,"
799,19,"whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,"
800,19,"sings this to thee, 'thou single wilt prove none,'"
801,20,"not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul"
802,20,"of the wide world dreaming on things to come,"
803,20,"can yet the lease of my true love control,"
804,20,"suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom,"
805,20,"the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd"
806,20,"and the sad augurs mock their own presage;"
807,20,"incertainties now crown themselves assur'd"
808,20,"and peace proclaims olives of endless age,"
809,20,"now with the drops of this most balmy time"
810,20,"my love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,"
811,20,"since, spite of him, i'll live in this poor rhyme,"
812,20,"while he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;"
813,20,"and thou in this shalt find thy monument,"
814,20,"when tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent,"
815,21,"o, for my sake do you with fortune chide,"
816,21,"the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,"
817,21,"that did not better for my life provide"
818,21,"than public means which public manners breeds,"
819,21,"thence comes it that my name receives a brand,"
820,21,"and almost thence my nature is subdu'd"
821,21,"to what it works in, like the dyer's hand,"
822,21,"pity me then and wish i were renew'd;"
823,21,"whilst, like a willing patient, i will drink"
824,21,"potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;"
825,21,"no bitterness that i will bitter think,"
826,21,"nor double penance, to correct correction,"
827,21,"pity me then, dear friend, and i assure ye"
828,21,"even that your pity is enough to cure me,"
829,22,"those lips that love's own hand did make"
830,22,"breath'd forth the sound that said i hate"
831,22,"to me that languish'd for her sake,"
832,22,"but when she saw my woeful state,"
833,22,"straight in her heart did mercy come,"
834,22,"chiding that tongue, that ever sweet"
835,22,"was used in giving gentle doom,"
836,22,"and taught it thus anew to greet,"
837,22,"'i hate' she alter'd with an end"
838,22,"that follow'd it as gentle day"
839,22,"doth follow night, who like a fiend"
840,22,"from heaven to hell is flown away,"
841,22,"'i hate' from hate away she threw,"
842,22,"and sav'd my life, saying 'not you'"
843,23,"let me not to the marriage of true minds"
844,23,"admit impediments, love is not love"
845,23,"which alters when it alteration finds,"
846,23,"or bends with the remover to remove,"
847,23,"o no! it is an ever-fixed mark"
848,23,"that looks on tempests and is never shaken;"
849,23,"it is the star to every wandering bark,"
850,23,"whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken,"
851,23,"love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks"
852,23,"within his bending sickle's compass come,"
853,23,"love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,"
854,23,"but bears it out even to the edge of doom,"
855,23,"if this be error and upon me proved,"
856,23,"i never writ, nor no man ever loved,"
857,24,"my mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;"
858,24,"   coral is far more red than her lips' red,"
859,24,"   if snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;"
860,24,"   if hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head,"
861,24,"   i have seen roses damask'd, red and white,"
862,24,"   but no such roses see i in her cheeks;"
863,24,"   and in some perfumes is there more delight"
864,24,"   than in the breath that from my mistress reeks,"
865,24,"   i love to hear her speak, yet well i know"
866,24,"  that music hath a far more pleasing sound,"
867,24,"  i grant i never saw a goddess go,"
868,24,"  my mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground,"
869,24,"  and yet, by heaven, i think my love as rare"
870,24,"  as any she belied with false compare,"
871,25,"from fairest creatures we desire increase,"
872,25,"that thereby beauty's rose might never die,"
873,25,"but as the riper should by time decease,"
874,25,"his tender heir might bear his memory,"
875,25,"but thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,"
876,25,"feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,"
877,25,"making a famine where abundance lies,"
878,25,"thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel,"
879,25,"thou that art now the world's fresh ornament"
880,25,"and only herald to the gaudy spring,"
881,25,"within thine own bud buriest thy content"
882,25,"and, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding,"
883,25,"pity the world, or else this glutton be,"
884,25,"to eat the world's due, by the grave and thee,"
885,26,"when forty winters shall besiege thy brow,"
886,26,"and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,"
887,26,"thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,"
888,26,"will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held,"
889,26,"then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,"
890,26,"where all the treasure of thy lusty days,"
891,26,"to say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,"
892,26,"were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise,"
893,26,"how much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,"
894,26,"if thou couldst answer 'this fair child of mine"
895,26,"shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'"
896,26,"proving his beauty by succession thine!"
897,26,"this were to be new made when thou art old,"
898,26,"and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold,"
899,27,"look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest"
900,27,"now is the time that face should form another;"
901,27,"whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,"
902,27,"thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother,"
903,27,"for where is she so fair whose unear'd womb"
904,27,"disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?"
905,27,"or who is he so fond will be the tomb"
906,27,"of his self-love, to stop posterity?"
907,27,"thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee"
908,27,"calls back the lovely april of her prime,"
909,27,"so thou through windows of thine age shall see"
910,27,"despite of wrinkles this thy golden time,"
911,27,"but if thou live, remember'd not to be,"
912,27,"die single, and thine image dies with thee,"
913,28,"unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend"
914,28,"upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?"
915,28,"nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,"
916,28,"and being frank she lends to those are free,"
917,28,"then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse"
918,28,"the bounteous largess given thee to give?"
919,28,"profitless usurer, why dost thou use"
920,28,"so great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?"
921,28,"for having traffic with thy self alone,"
922,28,"thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,"
923,28,"then how when nature calls thee to be gone,"
924,28,"what acceptable audit canst thou leave?"
925,28,"thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,"
926,28,"which, used, lives th' executor to be,"
927,29,"when i have seen by time's fell hand defac'd"
928,29,"the rich proud cost of outworn buried age;"
929,29,"when sometime lofty towers i see down-ras'd"
930,29,"and brass eternal slave to mortal rage;"
931,29,"when i have seen the hungry ocean gain"
932,29,"advantage on the kingdom of the shore,"
933,29,"and the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,"
934,29,"increasing store with loss and loss with store;"
935,29,"when i have seen such interchange of state,"
936,29,"or state itself confounded to decay;"
937,29,"ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,"
938,29,"that time will come and take my love away,"
939,29,"this thought is as a death, which cannot choose"
940,29,"but weep to have that which it fears to lose,"
941,30,"those hours, that with gentle work did frame"
942,30,"the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,"
943,30,"will play the tyrants to the very same"
944,30,"and that unfair which fairly doth excel;"
945,30,"for never-resting time leads summer on"
946,30,"to hideous winter, and confounds him there;"
947,30,"sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,"
948,30,"beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where,"
949,30,"then were not summer's distillation left,"
950,30,"a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,"
951,30,"beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,"
952,30,"nor it, nor no remembrance what it was,"
953,30,"but flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,"
954,30,"leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet,"
955,31,"they that have power to hurt and will do none,"
956,31,"that do not do the thing they most do show,"
957,31,"who, moving others, are themselves as stone,"
958,31,"unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,"
959,31,"they rightly do inherit heaven's graces"
960,31,"and husband nature's riches from expense;"
961,31,"they are the lords and owners of their faces,"
962,31,"others but stewards of their excellence,"
963,31,"the summer's flower is to the summer sweet"
964,31,"though to itself it only live and die,"
965,31,"but if that flower with base infection meet,"
966,31,"the basest weed outbraves his dignity,"
967,31,"for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;"
968,31,"lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds,"
969,32,"when i consider everything that grows"
970,32,"holds in perfection but a little moment,"
971,32,"that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows"
972,32,"whereon the stars in secret influence comment;"
973,32,"when i perceive that men as plants increase,"
974,32,"cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,"
975,32,"vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,"
976,32,"and wear their brave state out of memory;"
977,32,"then the conceit of this inconstant stay"
978,32,"sets you most rich in youth before my sight,"
979,32,"where wasteful time debateth with decay"
980,32,"to change your day of youth to sullied night;"
981,32,"and all in war with time for love of you,"
982,32,"as he takes from you, i engraft you new,"
